# Port-Scanner
Side project that I am slowly working on as I learn new networking concepts and security practices.

I am utilizing LLMs such as ChatGPT and Copilot to accelerate the speed at which I can write code and assist in explaining how different functions work to achieve different goals within the project.
I started this project to learn more about how computers interact and communicate on the internet.


#### External programs
This project utilizes things such as nmap and zap 2.16.0 
These programs allow me to call functions to connect with open ports and find vulnerabilities in websites.
